                    <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
                    <p>
                      Dental implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and
                      function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat virtually
                      anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours
                      will be preserved.
                      Dental implants are changing the way people live. With them, people are rediscovering the comfort
                      and confidence to eat, speak, laugh and enjoy life.

                    <h3>Wisdom Teeth</h3>
                    <p>
                      If a wisdom tooth is deemed to be problematic, it will usually be extracted to avoid any potential
                      oral complications. To have a wisdom tooth removed, a small incision in the gum tissue is made to
                      expose the tooth and any bone that may be covering the tooth. Once the tooth is in view, it is
                      gently grasped with a dental instrument, known as a forcep, and gently rocked back and forth to
                      loosen it from the jawbone and surrounding ligaments. Occasionally, the tooth may need to be cut
                      into smaller pieces to make it removal easier. Once the tooth has been removed, stitches may be
                      placed to expedite the healing process.

                    <h3>Bone Grafting</h3>
                    <p>
                      Bone grafting is the replacement or enhancement of bone around teeth. When a tooth is lost, the
                      surrounding bone collapses. Bone grafting is performed to reverse bone loss or enhance existing
                      bone. The grafting material can be taken from parts of the body or from synthetic material. Bone
                      grafting allows for proper support of dental implants or prostheses.

                    <p>
                      Orthognathic surgery is done to correct misalignments or other abnormalities in the upper and/or
                      lower jaw.

                      Orthognathic surgery can involve procedures such as an osteotomy (bone cutting), bone grafts, or
                      distraction osteogenes is (stretching of the bone) and orthodontic (braces) care.Orthognathic
                      correction is conducted in stages, and the course of treatment can last from a few months to a
                      year or more.

                      In order to perform the procedure successfully, the jawbones will be repositioned in accordance
                      with one’s specific needs.Inconspicuous incisions are usually made inside, and if needed, outside
                      the mouth to allow for surgical plates, screws, wires and rubber bands to be used to hold your
                      jaws in their new positions.

                    <p>
                      Facial trauma involves injuries to the bone, teeth, skin, gums or other soft tissues.

                      Depending on the type of facial trauma sustained, there are many different treatment options
                      available. The primary goals of treatment are to stop any bleeding from occurring, create a clear
                      airway, repair any broken or fractured bone, and or suture any damaged soft tissue. Treatment is
                      immediate, as long as there are no neck fractures or life-threatening injuries.

                    <p>
                      A tooth that can not be saved with restorative materials may need to be removed. First, the area
                      will be numbed with anesthesia. The tooth is then loosened with a special dental instrument known
                      as an elevator. After the tooth is loosened from the socket, it is removed. Stitches may be
                      necessary after the removal of a tooth.

                    <p>
                      A frenectomy is a simple surgical procedure performed to release the connection of the “frenum,” a
                      connective muscle between two tissues. There are two types of oral frenectomies that are
                      frequently performed on both adults and children for a variety of reasons.

                      A Labial Frenectomy is performed on the tissue that connects the lip to the gums. This may be
                      performed on children or adults to aid with orthodontic treatment or even help with the proper
                      fitting for a denture or appliance.

                      A Lingual Frenectomy may also be referred to as the release of tongue-ties (ankyloglossia). This
                      procedure is performed on the connective tissue under the tongue. The procedure is often performed
                      on neonatal patients to assist with nursing or on toddlers or older patients who need the surgery
                      to help correct speech issues caused by limited movement due the the frenum.

                    <h3>TMJ</h3>
                    <p>
                      The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is similar to a sliding hinge that connects your jawbone to your
                      skull. TMJ disorders can cause pain in the jaw joint and in the muscles that control jaw movement.

                      To treat TMJ disorders, first the cause has to be identified. In less severe cases TMJ disorders
                      can be treated with self-managed care (eating soft foods, using ice packs, avoiding extreme jaw
                      movement) or nonsurgical treatments (anti-inflammatory medications, Botox injections, or
                      stabilization splints). In severe cases surgical treatments (jaw joint replacements) may be
                      necessary.

                      TMJ conditions fall into three main categories:

                      Myofascial pain – discomfort or pain in the muscles that control jaw function.

                      Internal derangement of the joint – a possible indicator of a displaced disc, dislocated jaw, or
                      injury to the condyle.

                      Arthritis – a degenerative inflammatory disorder.

                    <p>
                      Cone Beam technology provides a 3D digital tomographic view of the patient’s area of interest. A
                      traditional x-ray is only two-dimensional. With our KODAK Cone Beam system, our doctors are able
                      to get a full 360 degree view of the tooth and all surrounding areas. The 3D Cone Beam scanner
                      provides nearly limitless views of the teeth while using less radiation than traditional medical
                      CT technology. This new technology is fast, simple and painless, providing many wonderful benefits
                      that were unavailable only a few years ago.

                    <p>
                      Our highly qualified staff is trained to provide IV sedation in the comfort of our office.

                      IV sedation is an alternative sedation that allows patients to be very relaxed during procedures.
                      Your doctor will combine the use of IV sedation along with a local anesthetic so you have little
                      to no discomfort and will have no memory of the procedure.

                      For IV Sedation, patients’ vital signs, such as blood pressure and heart rate, are continuously
                      monitored by our trained staff. Patients should plan to have someone bring them to the appointment
                      and be available to drive them home following treatment.

                    <h3>Platelet Rich Growth Factor</h3>
                    <p>
                      Platelet Rich Growth Factors and Platelet Rich Fibrin are new techniques used to assist with
                      tissue regeneration using the patient’s own tissues and centrifugation to minimize healing time
                      and maximize healing potential following procedures.

                      These growth factors are in the form of a mixed gel that can be applied directly into tooth
                      sockets and other sites. Placing this material in tooth sockets after tooth extractions can
                      improve soft tissue healing and positively influence bone regeneration.

                      These techniques offer a new approach to tissue regeneration. PRP derives from the centrifugation
                      of a patient’s own blood and contains growth factors that influence wound healing. This is
                      important in tissue repairing mechanisms. The use of PRP in surgical practice could have
                      beneficial outcomes, reducing bleeding and enhancing soft tissue healing and bone regeneration.

                    <h3>Exposure of Impacted Teeth</h3>
                    <p>
                      An impacted tooth is a tooth that fails to fully pass through the gums.

                      Impacted wisdom and cuspid (or canine) teeth are fairly common. To correct impacted teeth, there
                      are a few treatment options. For impacted wisdom teeth, the most common procedure is extraction.
                      For impacted canine teeth, several treatment modalities are available. Orthodontics (braces) can
                      be used to open space for proper eruption. Primary (baby) teeth can either be extracted or
                      surgically exposed to allow for the placement of an orthodontic bracket to help align the teeth.
